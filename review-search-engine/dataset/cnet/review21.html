No AF adjustment is a big turn off to users of the Canon 50D who were looking forward to upgrading, and the lower 5.3 fps continuous shooting feels like a step back from previous models as well.<br /><br />The Canon 60D does have some great features, however and it is these reasons why I bought it over the 7D. It feels big and bulky like its bigger brother, has a great articulating LCD screen and it has a top screen with individual controls for making quick adjustments without going to the LCD screen, which makes life a little easier. The camera is fast, the shutter is quicker and quieter than my old Rebel. Low light performance is very good with excellent performance at 800 ISO, very good at 1600 ISO, and good at 3200 ISO with little "obvious" noise. After 3200 it gets pretty noisy.<br /><br />The 60 has some great features, such as wireless flash control (for up to 2 external speedlights), and the ability to put custom functions in your "my menu" without having to fuble through the Custom Functions menus every time you need to change a setting. <br /><br />The 60D sports EXCELLENT HD 1080P video, and if you have a faster SD card (mine is 100X which pros say is slow but I've never had any lag) the video goes as high as 30fps on 1080P and even higher when you reduce the resolution.<br /><br />Overall it is an excellent camera for shmucks like me who want something more advanced than a Rebel, but I stress this: If budget is of no concern and you want a strong, sturdy camera that looks, feels and acts pro with all the pro features you could want, go with the 7D. It has DUAL processors, 8fps continuous shooting, a metal body and AF adjustment. And with Nikon's new D7000 with a metal body and loads of neat features for a mere couple hundred bucks more, you might go that route as well.<br /><br />If you are a Rebel upgrader who wants "pro" like quality and function without the "pro" price, then the 60D might just be your ticket. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li messageId="10096653"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10096653&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10096653%26cval%3D10096653%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (1) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10096653&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10096653%26cval%3D10096653%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-60d-body/4864-6501_7-34157106.html?messageID=10096653" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div> <!-- /reply --> </li>
