My primary uses include mostly outdoor landscapes and wildlife; little/no studio and indoor use. I almost exclusively use a 2-lens kit chosen for portability and high IQ at f/5.6-f/8: the Canon EF-S 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 IS, and the Canon 70-300 f/4-5.6 IS. <br /> <br />After taking my first 2000 frames, I am generally giddy about the camera, and look forward to years of terrific photos (and some nice videos) from this device. The huge screen, burst rate, buffer, and high-ISO IQ have markedly improved my pictures. I'm particularly impressed with the battery life (still on my first charge after 2000 images). I highly recommend the 60D as the ultimate Rebel step-up if you can handle the size and weight (it might even be worth getting in better shape so that you can travel, hike, ski, and cycle with this wonderful piece of technology). Only the very best glass is a match for this sensor!<br /> <br />There are many comprehensive reviews of this camera that I will not try to duplicate (I was very happy with the collection of reviews and other resources at northlight-images.co.uk). I only wish to make two points that are sometimes buried in other reviews.<br /> <br />First, it was insulting for Canon to leave out the AF Microadjust feature, especially since it is only a software characteristic (no hardware change necessary). Though I won't often use the very-fast lenses that most benefit from this feature (making very small camera adjustments to account for minor lens front- or back-focus), it would have been nice to know that I could rent a long/fast lens for a safari or bear viewing trip, and be absolutely sure that I could achieve perfect focus on my camera body. I hope Canon comes through with a firmware update to add this capability to the 60D.<br /> <br />Second, though this body is small and light when compared to a professional model, it is heavier and bulkier than I want (I was perhaps spoiled by the XT). I realize that I have an incongruent set of expectations: Rebel price, small/light, but pro SLR IQ and features. Though "prosumer" owners of the 50D and 7D rely use their cameras' bulk and weight for publicity, the 60D is a squarely "consumer" camera. I value the ability to blend into a crowd, to hike or cycle with my camera, and to fit my camera into my carry-on luggage. Thanks to Canon for the lighter/cheaper plastic body; keep up the work to make your top consumer camera lighter and smaller. Save the magnesium for people who get paid to lift it.<br /> <br />Definitely worth buying a new camera holster, hefting the extra weight, and buying lots more SD cards to use the fantastic screen and sensor in the backcountry. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li messageId="10096982"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10096982&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10096982%26cval%3D10096982%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (0) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10096982&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10096982%26cval%3D10096982%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-60d-body/4864-6501_7-34157106.html?messageID=10096982" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div>
