See below.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher price.</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Well, the new T2i has new metering, a better battery, higher megapixels, different sized LCD &#38; improved HD video.

<br />
<br />My question is simple, is it worth the extra $200 or so to go for it over the very good T1i? <br />
<br />At this point, the 2009 T1i will be on sale and will provide 95% of the camera that the T2i offers. <br />
<br />You tell me, which would you buy if Canon were the final choice in this category of DSLRs?<br /><br /><span class='notifyMsg'> Updated </span>on Feb 27, 2010</p><p/>I returned the T1i for the T2i and they added a bag, filter &#38; battery. Great service from Future Shop, big Pro. <br />Firstly, the T1i battery charger was a compact unit which had no cord, this one needs a cord, Con. <br />The LCD is clearer and larger, a Pro.
<br />The grip seems more comfortable in my large hands, Pro.
<br />The software was updated, Pro.
<br />The rear buttons are easier to utilize, larger top knob, dedicated live view button, Pro.

<br />Limited videography as of today, but the potential is there for some impressive videos, Pro.
<br />More capacity with the new battery and accepts newer memory cards, Pro. <br />Not any heavier, looks fantastic, glad I returned the T1i. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-rebel-t2i/4864-6501_7-33974698-4.html#commentList">Read replies (6)</a> </li> <li messageId="10067146"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10067146&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10067146%26cval%3D10067146%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (9) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10067146&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10067146%26cval%3D10067146%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (5) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-rebel-t2i/4864-6501_7-33974698.html?messageID=10067146" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div> <!-- /reply --> </li>
