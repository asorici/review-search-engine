A superb camera with a quality feel and great image quality. The 60D takes me back 20 years to that time. <br />My last digital camera was the Sony DSC-R1. A truly magestic pro-sumer camera with a lens to die for. But quite short on features. The 60D seems to combine the mechanical and reliability features of the AE-1 and the digital perfection of my Sony. <br />I was sorely tempted by the A55, and loved the feature set. But please, do not buy the A55 on-line, as I found it very small in my hand. Several of my fingers did not know where to go, so small was the grip.

<br />I love the dynamic range of the images the 60D produces and the features that expand on that, with the Highlight Tone Priority and Auto Lighting Optimiser, the images have great quality in all lighting situations.
<br />The kit lens (17-85mm) is mediocre at best, but the Digital Photo Professional, bundled with the camera, has excellent aberration correctioanl features. It retrurns very high quality images - especially from RAW. I recommend buying the body only and spending some money on quality glass.
<br />I love this camera, but my experience with quality DSLRs is limited. Value for money is fantastic. You will see some of my images on Flickr (Raggiebag). </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li messageId="10093184"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10093184&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10093184%26cval%3D10093184%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (1) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10093184&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-34157106.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10093184%26cval%3D10093184%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-60d-body/4864-6501_7-34157106.html?messageID=10093184" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div> <!-- /reply --> </li>
