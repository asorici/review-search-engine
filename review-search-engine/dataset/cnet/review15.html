Focus is fast and I.S. is very effective.<br />-LCD is bright and clear, easy to determine focus (if you're not using the viewfinder).<br />-Controls (with one exception, see Cons)<br />-HD Video</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> -Separate button for video capture. It's nice to have the option of taking a still while shooting a movie, but they should have used the main shutter button for video capture and used the other for taking stills (in video mode).</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> I had done quite a bit of research in looking for a new digital camera. Not that my Canon Digital Elph was bad, but I was looking for something that I could have a lot more control over. I did look at fixed lens/mega zoom cameras as the thought of having a wide zoom range readily available was appealing, but the quality of most interchangeable lenses far exceeds that of a fixed lens system. Being able to shoot true high definition was also a factor, and I felt that the T2i had more options with exposure control and frame rate. In the end, it was just the sheer amount of features that the T2i has that put it way ahead of the other cameras I was looking at (T1i, Pentax K-x, Nikon D90).<br /><br />Aside from the video capture button the only other problem i noticed was what I discovered to be a "hot pixel" issue. This may be an issue with other cameras, but I do not know. For me, I noticed that there were a couple blue and red pixels in a couple of the still images and even in one video. Having a couple discolored pixels is easy enough to ignore/photoshop out, but they are very noticeable in low-light videos (and much harder to remove). Fortunately, I was able to learn that setting the camera to "manual sensor cleaning mode" for a few seconds (without actually removing the lens or coming anywhere near the sensor) fixed the problem. I haven't come across any more problem pixels in the past week since first seeing it, so it seems like a non-issue at this point.<br /><br />Bottom line, this camera is perfect for what I was looking for: a higher-than-entry-level DSLR with an abundance of excellent features. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li messageId="10078477"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10078477&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10078477%26cval%3D10078477%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (4) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10078477&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10078477%26cval%3D10078477%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-rebel-t2i/4864-6501_7-33974698.html?messageID=10078477" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div>
