After using this camera, I think that, despite not having manual control of aperture and shutter speed, it might be more suitable for photographers who can appreciate and make use of the wider angle and the faster lens. If you're not going to be taking advantage of its low light abilities, a lesser camera in the Sony line would save you money. Otherwise, it's a wonderful pocket camera for photographers who might also have an SLR. I've been especially impressed with its low light abilities, and a 24 mm wide angle opens up a lot more possibilites for creative photographers than does the typical 28 mm. It's great for night time street photography.<br /><br /><span class='notifyMsg'> Updated </span>on Feb 21, 2010</p><p/>If you get this camera, you can get started quickly using the included printed manual, but for best result beyond just pointing and shooting, I highly recommend reading through the Handbook, which you must install separately from the software on the included CD. It goes into more detail about the various modes and functions. Want to know when to use Motion Blur mode as opposed to Handheld Twilight mode, or how to set your own white balance manually, the Handbook is the place to look. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li messageId="10067632"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10067632&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33763789.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10067632%26cval%3D10067632%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (1) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10067632&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33763789.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10067632%26cval%3D10067632%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/sony-cyber-shot-dsc/4864-6501_7-33763789.html?messageID=10067632" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div> <!-- /reply --> </li>
