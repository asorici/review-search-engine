HD video recording capability. uses SanDisk memory card which makes it easy to transfer files.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very small and lightweight which promotes camera shake. Some ways to alleviate this is to get a battery grip and/or use a heavy lens w/ IS. The max shutter speed is at 1/4000 and continuous shooting is only 3.7</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This camera is a must have for 1st time DSLR buyers. The feautures are comparable to the semi-professional cameras such as the Canon 50D and 7D, and the kit lens (18-55mm) produces better images than the 50D/7D kit lens (28-124mm). This camera still produces good images at a high ISO3200. ISO6400 is pretty fuzzy and the H-ISO is beyond fuzzy...I cant see why anyone would want to use that. For a 1.6x cropped sensor (APS-C sensor) , it produces good 18MP images. The AutoExposureBracketing feature and AutoWhiteBracketing features are fun and easy to use. The controls/buttons are ergonomically perfect. They are not difficult to use/press and cannot be pressed easily by mistake. The camera is a little light for me as it promotes easy 'camera shake' on my light lens without IS. The battery lasts several hundred shots for me which is better than most cameras. All the controls and settings are visible in the view finder and do not get in the way of your view. You can also take pictures using the 'Live View mode' which is the 3inch LCD screen. Most DSLR cameras dont have this feature which i find quite odd since it is mostly used in point and shoot cameras. Another feature installed in this camera is the CreativeAuto mode which enables to user to control the 'bokeh', the blurred background and the brightness of the subject/background. The continuous shooting is only 3.7 frames per second. Its still pretty fast however would be nicer if it was at least 6fps which is condusive for sports photography. The AutoFocus has a 9point CMOS sensor instead of 19point sensor like the 50D and 7D. overall, this is a great entry DSLR, the best in its class for its features and for its price. This SLR camera is half the price of the 7D and the major differences is only the slower shutter spd of 1/4000 vs. 1/8000, the continuous shooting of 3.7fps vs. the 7D's 8.0fps, and the differences in the AF points. Its those 3 major differences that kept me from buying the 7D and saving the extra $900. Plus the built in flash shoot 1meter (3.2ft) farther than the 7D's built in flash, and the kit lens produces higher image quality pictures than the kit lens for the 7D. </p> <div class="reply"> <ul> <li class="first"> <p class="replyUR"><a class="reply">Reply to this review</a></p> </li> <li> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-rebel-t2i/4864-6501_7-33974698-1.html#commentList">Read reply (1)</a> </li> <li messageId="10078460"> <p style="display: none;" id="thanksForFeedback">Thank you for submitting your feedback!</p> <p class="rateUR"> <span class="isHelpful">Was this review helpful?</span> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10078460&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10078460%26cval%3D10078460%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=1&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsUp"> (9) </span> </a> <a class="submitHelpful" href="/8663-6501_7-0.html?messageID=10078460&returnUrl=http%3A%2F%2Freviews.cnet.com%2F4864-6501_7-33974698.html%3Fctype%3Dmsgid%26messageSiteID%3D7%26messageID%3D10078460%26cval%3D10078460%26helpvote%3Dtrue%26tag%3Duolst&usrAction=1&rating=0&publisherUrsRegId=" rel="nofollow"> <span class="thumbsDown"> (0) </span> </a> </p> </li> </ul> <div class="postTools"> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="report toolTipElement" title="Report this post::Click here to report this comment to an administrator">Report this post</a> <a class="email toolTipElement" title="Email this post::Click here to email this comment to a friend">Email this post</a> <a href="/digital-cameras/canon-eos-rebel-t2i/4864-6501_7-33974698.html?messageID=10078460" class="permalink toolTipElement" title="Permalink to this post::Click here to permalink to this comment">Permalink to this post</a> </div> </div> <!-- /reply --> </li>
